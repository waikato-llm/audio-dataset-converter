Changelog
=========

0.1.0 (????-??-??)
------------------

- `split-records` filter now allows specifying the meta-data field in which to store the split name
- the `tee` meta-filter can now forward or drop the incoming data based on a meta-data evaluation
- the `sub-process` filter can be used for processing data with sub-flow of filters, can be conditional based on meta-data evaluation
- the `metadata-from-name` filter can work on the path now as well (must be present)
- switched to `kasperl` library for base API and generic pipeline plugins
- added `@abc.abstractmethod` decorator where appropriate
- the `adc-exec` tool now uses all remaining parameters as the pipeline components rather than having
  to specify them via the `-p/--pipeline` parameter, making it easy to simply prefix the `adc-exec`
  command to an existing `adc-convert` command-line
- added the `text-file` and `csv-file` generators that work off files to populate the variable(s)
- added support for class lister with ignored classes
- `adc-exec` can load pipelines from file now as well, useful when dealing with large pipelines
- added `--load_pipeline` option to `adc-convert`
- added `from-text-file` reader and `to-text-file` writer
- readers now locate files the first time the `read()` method gets called rather than in the
  `initialized()`, to allow more dynamic placeholders
- added `from-text-file` reader and `to-text-file` writer
- added `block`, `stop` filters for controlling the flow of data (via meta-data conditions)
- added email support with `get-email` reader and `send-email` writer
- added `list-files` reader for listing files in a directory
- added `list-to-sequence` stream filter that forwards list items one by one
- added `console` writer for outputting the data on stdout that is coming through
- added `watch-dir` meta-reader that uses the watchdog library to react to file-system events
  rather than using fixed-interval polling like `poll-dir`
- added `delete-files` writer
- added `copy-files` filter
- added support for caching plugins via `ADC_CLASS_CACHE` environment variable

- `to-adams-sp` writer now uses `-t` short flag for the transcript like the `from-adams-sp` reader
